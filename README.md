NIBBLE65 Acrylic Case


## File Information
Layers
* L0: Bottom layer (3mm acrylic)
* L1: Closed layer (3mm acrylic)
* L2: Closed layer (3mm acrylic)
* L3: Closed layer (3mm acrylic)
* L4: USB Cutout layer (3mm acrylic)
* L5: Switch Plate (1.5mm POM)
  * This layer needs to be 1.5mm and needs to be POM. I've found POM to be the best material at this width. I tried 1.5mm acrylic plates and they cracked when putting switches in. Use acrylic at your own risk.
* L6: USB Cutout layer (3mm acrylic)
* L7: Top layer (3mm clear acrylic)



All layers have the same dimensions: 343.85mm x 140.25mm


USB Cutout is meant to be used with a thin style USB cable, like [this one.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M16YSTB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
